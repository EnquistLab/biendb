Issues with TNRS processing

1. Embedded line endings

TNRS can handle different line endings in same file, but not if line endings come before end of line (e.g., surrounded by quotes).

To visualize line endings:

cat -e filename

- DOS line endings: ^M
- UNIX line endings: $

To remove dos line endings, at end of lines only:

dos2unix filename

To remove embedded line endings:

sed -i -e 's/\r//g' filename
